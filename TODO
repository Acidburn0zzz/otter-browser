Medium priority / soon:
- mail and feeds client (as module)

- tabs grouping
- import of existing settings etc.
- allow to overwrite list of available context menu actions
- extensions
- Opera Link like solution
- improved integration with different platforms (Windows taskbar integration etc.)

Low priority / maybe:
- support for Opera skins (through custom QStyle)
- IM client module (libpurple based, including support for IRC)
- BitTorrent module
- support for tab thumbnails embedded in tab bar

And lots of smaller things. ;-)
