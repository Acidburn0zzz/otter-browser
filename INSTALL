To install Otter Browser from source you need to have Qt SDK (5.2.0 or newer) installed (http://qt-project.org/).

You can use CMake (2.8.10.2 or newer) build system (preferred):
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make
make install

Alternatively you can use either Qt Creator IDE to compile sources or execute following commands in directory containing otter.pro file:
mkdir build
cd build
qmake ../otter.pro
make
make install
