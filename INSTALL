To install Otter Browser from source you need to have Qt SDK (5.2.0 or newer) installed (available at: http://www.qt.io/download-open-source/).

You can use CMake (2.8.10.2 or newer) build system (preferred):
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make
make install

Alternatively you can use either Qt Creator IDE to compile sources or execute following commands in directory containing otter.pro file:
mkdir build
cd build
qmake ../otter.pro
make
make install

Sometimes you may need to manually add QtConcurrent to list of required modules, in case of CMake build system you have to modify CMakeLists.txt by adding it to line starting with "qt5_use_modules(otter-browser ", resulting in "qt5_use_modules(otter-browser Concurrent ".
Or add it to otter.pro, adding it to list starting with "QT += core", resulting in "QT += core concurrent ".
